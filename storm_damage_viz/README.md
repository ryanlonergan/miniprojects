When browsing the [dataisbeautiful subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/), I came across a visualization for storm damages by season. At the time, it was during hurricane season so storms were being talked in the news a lot so I knew something was up with the data. The poster had reported spring as the season where most damages occured, but summer and fall should have lead the chart. I was not the only person who noticed something was up with the data and thankfully the poster included his datasource, so I decided to investigate to see where they went wrong.
